# DrivenData Pump It Up Challenge
This repo contains my exploratory data analysis and modeling for the Driven Data "Pump it up challenge". The goal was to classify water pumps in Tanzania as functional, functional but in need of repair, or non-functional. I took this on as an afternoon project one weekend. My best submission had a classification rate of .7830, which falls in the top 25% of 10K plus submissions.
